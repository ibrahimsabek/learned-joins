Code in this folder and it's subfolders was taken from the suxcpp repository: 
https://github.com/vigna/sux.git, only slightly modified to be 
1) usable within this codebase
2) lightweight in the sense that most unused functionality was plainly removed
The following licensing applies:

Sux is licensed exactly like `libstdc++` (GPLv3 + GCC Runtime Library
Exception), which essentially means you can use it everywhere, exactly
like `libstdc++`.
